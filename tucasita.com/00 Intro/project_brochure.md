# Market value
The current market offers an extensive range of options, and new players emerge every year

## Value proposition
* Responsive Listings: Property listings are more than just text and images. At Tucasita.com, we believe in responsive, dynamic listings that adjust to the user's device, ensuring a smooth browsing experience whether you're on a computer, tablet, or smartphone.

* Efficient Property Search: No more endless scrolling or vague searches. With our intuitive text search and location filters, finding the perfect property becomes a task of minutes, not hours.

* Advanced Feature Recognition: Our state-of-the-art photogrammetry and machine learning algorithms identify the nuances of each property â€“ from the size of the rooms to the quality of bathrooms, the age of the property, or even the expanse of gardens. For buyers, this means a tailored search experience that truly understands your preferences.

## Target market
* Property Agents: For agents aiming to expand their clientele, Tucasita.com offers a platform to reach a broader, tech-savvy audience who prioritize digital platforms for property searches.

* Potential Property Buyers: From young adults looking for their first homes to retirees wanting a serene space, our platform caters to a diverse set of buyers with varied property requirements.

# Project scope
tucasita.com should be recognized as the new player in town for property tech, gaining quick traction to list thousands of properties of hundreds of agents and buyers in the first 6 months. To do that, an aggressive social media campaign and beta testing of new features at early stages must be critical to the success of the project.

## Project goals
User-Centric Platform: One of the primary goals of Tucasita.com is to create a user-centric platform, ensuring easy navigation, quick load times, and a clutter-free interface for all users, regardless of their tech proficiency.

Integration of Advanced Technologies: By integrating photogrammetry and machine learning, we aim to revolutionize the way properties are listed and searched, making the process more efficient and tailored to individual needs.

Community Building: Another major goal is to foster a community of agents and buyers, offering forums, webinars, and Q&A sessions to address doubts, share insights, and discuss market trends.
