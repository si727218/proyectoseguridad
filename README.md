# What is this repository for?

This repository describes the requirements, design and architecture of a ficticious property marketplace system.

The main purpose is to provide documents used as a the basis for a software development project that requires deep analysis of security requirements and architecture.

# How do I use this repository?

Fork this repo and rearrange the documents to fit a more organized and maintanable development project with security in mind.

Add any sections and documents you think are missing to clarify the security requirements and architecture of the system.

# Principles to consider
* Follow existing frameworks and standards
    * Use references researched and documented by others
* Split the analysis into modules focused on specific aspects of the system security
* When reorganizing any documents, update the index.md file to reflect the new structure
* Use the [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) syntax to format the documents
* Do not modify the security requirements or architecture in a way that comprise the feature requirements.
